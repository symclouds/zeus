1. Add all the Lambda functions for the project to the ./src folder

2. If dependencies are missing they will be found during packaging and can be added

	$> npm i <package name> --save-dev  e.g: npm i @aws-sdk/client-s3s

3. Build the esbuild package from the top level (node_module level)
   This will compress the function code as well as all its dependencies into a single file (index.js)
   In addition it will build a .map file but I'm uncertain how that will be used (inded.js.map)
   The resulting files will be written to: ./dist/<functionName> 

	$> npm run build

4. Finally we need to build ZIP archives of the packages so we can run them in Lambda
   The resulting zip files will be written to: ./dist/<functionName.zip>

	$> npm run package
